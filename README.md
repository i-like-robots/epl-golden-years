## About

A copy of the API is currently hosted on Vercel; the Open API definition can be found [here](https://epl-golden-years.vercel.app/rest/schema.json) and the GraphQL Schema is [here](https://epl-golden-years.vercel.app/graphql/schema.gql).

Currently WIP ðŸ‘·

### Requirements

To get started on working with the app, you'll need to make sure you have the following software tools installed.

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or higher is required)
3. [npm](http://npmjs.com/)

Please note that this project has only been tested in Mac and Linux environments. If you are on a Mac you may find it easiest to install the [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) package which includes Git.

### Project setup

1. Clone the Git repository and change to the new directory that has been created:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:i-like-robots/epl-golden-years
    cd epl-golden-years
    ```

2. Install all of the project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. You can now start and visit the running application in watch mode for development:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
